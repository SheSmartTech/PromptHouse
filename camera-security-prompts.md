# Smart Camera Streaming Security Prompts

## Audit Privacy Settings
"Review my smart cameras and create a checklist to ensure Iâ€™ve disabled remote viewing, microphone access, and cloud storage where not needed."

## Access Control
"Write an automation that disables camera streams when family members are home but activates them with motion detection when we're away."

## Network Segmentation
"Generate a step-by-step guide to put my smart cameras on a separate guest WiFi or VLAN so if hacked, they can't access my computers."

## Encryption & Updates
"Create a monthly routine to check firmware updates and revalidate that my smart cameras are using end-to-end encryption."

## Visitor & Delivery Mode
