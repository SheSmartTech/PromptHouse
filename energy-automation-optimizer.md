# Energy Automation Optimizer Prompts

This set of AI prompts helps you analyze, automate, and reduce energy use across smart plugs, thermostats, appliances, EV chargers, and lighting. Designed for homeowners who want more than convenience — they want measurable savings and efficiency.

---

## Usage Profiling
"Given data from my smart plugs and energy monitors over the past 60 days, identify the top five devices that contribute most to my energy bill. Include estimated costs per device."

---

## Load Shifting
"Design automations that shift laundry, dishwasher, and EV charging to the lowest utility cost hours based on my regional time-of-use pricing."

---

## Dynamic HVAC Adjustments
"Create occupancy-based HVAC schedules that relax setpoints by 2-3 degrees when rooms are vacant for over 20 minutes, but quickly return to comfort levels when occupancy is detected."

---

## Smart Lighting Efficiency
"Write a set of automations that use ambient light sensors and smart blinds to minimize artificial lighting. Include scenarios for cloudy days, direct sunlight, and evening transitions."

---

## Real ROI Calculation
"Based on an assumed local rate of $0.14/kWh, estimate monthly and annual savings for these automations if they reduce my total energy use by 8%."

---

## Solar + Storage Coordination
"If I install a solar array and battery, generate smart automations that prioritize heavy loads when solar is abundant and minimize grid draw during peak rates."

---

## Standby Power Kill
"Create a nightly routine that shuts off all entertainment centers, coffee makers, and chargers via smart plugs, and gives a summary report of estimated standby savings."

---

## Alert on Energy Spikes
"Draft an automation that sends a push notification if any device draws more than 500W for over 10 minutes outside of known schedules, to catch stuck appliances or unexpected loads."

---

## Appliance Lifecycle Tracking
"Build an automation that logs runtime hours of my washing machine, dryer, and HVAC so I can predict maintenance needs and energy ROI."

---

## Audit & Tune-Up Prompt
"Generate a quarterly checklist to review device schedules, run times, and new automation opportunities to keep my home energy-optimized."
